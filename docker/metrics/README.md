Running `just metrics` from the root of the repo will start:

    Grafana server
    Influx DB
    Telegraf

Once all the services have started, open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to view Grafana.
The default username and password are both `admin`.

The Influx server is available within docker at `http://splinter-influx:8086`
and exposed on your local machine at `http://localhost:8086`.

A test container named `splinter-telegraf` is provided to feed data into
Grafana to show that everything is working.

Press `^c` to shut down the network.

The compose file makes use of Docker named volumes for grafana and influx.
To delete these volumes,
run `docker-compose -f docker/metrics/docker-compose.yaml down -v` or
`just metrics-clean` from the root of the repo.
